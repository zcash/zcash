ZcashPlus is fork of [ZcashPlus](http://www.zcashplus.org/) is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.

This software is the ZcashPlus client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of ZcashPlus transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.
