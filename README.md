What is Zcash?
--------------

Zcash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to
offer a far higher standard of privacy and anonymity through a sophisticiated zero-knowledge
proving scheme which preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are
available in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).

**Zcash is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.

Participation in the Zcash project is subject to a [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
