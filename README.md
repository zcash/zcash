What is Zcash?
----------------

Zcash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to
offer a far higher standard of privacy and anonymity through a sophisticiated zero-knowledge
proving scheme which preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata.

**Zcash is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.
