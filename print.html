<p><a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> is HTTPS for money.</p>
<p>Initially based on Bitcoin's design, Zcash has been developed from
the Zerocash protocol to offer a far higher standard of privacy and
anonymity. It uses a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme to
preserve confidentiality and hide the connections between shielded
transactions. More technical details are available in our
<a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Protocol Specification</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-zcashd-full-node"><a class="header" href="#the-zcashd-full-node">The <code>zcashd</code> Full Node</a></h2>
<p>This repository hosts the <code>zcashd</code> software, a Zcash consensus node
implementation. It downloads and stores the entire history of Zcash
transactions. Depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take several days.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/imgs/zcashd_screen.gif" height="500">
</p>
<p>The <code>zcashd</code> code is derived from a source fork of
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core</a>. The code was forked
initially from Bitcoin Core v0.11.2, and the two codebases have diverged
substantially.</p>

<h2 id="release-cadence-and-support-window"><a class="header" href="#release-cadence-and-support-window">Release cadence and support window</a></h2>
<p><code>zcashd</code> releases happen approximately every six weeks, although this may change if a
particular release is delayed, or if a hotfix release occurs.</p>
<p>Each <code>zcashd</code> release is generally supported for 16 weeks. Occasionally this changes for
individual releases (for example, near to a Network Upgrade activation).</p>
<p>These two policies mean that there are generally at least two separate <code>zcashd</code> versions
currently supported at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-support-halt"><a class="header" href="#end-of-support-halt">End-of-Support halt</a></h2>
<p>Every <code>zcashd</code> version released by ECC has an End-of-Support height. When the Zcash chain
reaches this height, <code>zcashd</code> will automatically shut down, and the binary will refuse to
restart. This is for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>zcashd</code> maintainers do not have the resources to maintain old versions of <code>zcashd</code>
indefinitely.</li>
<li>Each time a user upgrades their <code>zcashd</code> node, they are re-confirming that they are
happy to run the Zcash consensus rules encoded in the version of <code>zcashd</code> they are
running. This is an important part of the overall strategy for changes to the node and
consensus rules; users who want to follow different rules (or even just have a different
End-of-Support halt policy) will obtain a <code>zcashd</code> binary from some other source, with
its own support policies.</li>
<li>Knowing that old versions will shut down is useful for planning backwards-incompatible
changes in Network Upgrades. A Network Upgrade activation can be targeted for a height
where we know that all released <code>zcashd</code> versions which <em>did not</em> support the Network
Upgrade will have shut down by the time the Network Upgrade activates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-of-support-heights"><a class="header" href="#end-of-support-heights">End-of-Support heights</a></h2>
<p>The End-of-Support height for a running <code>zcashd</code> can be queried over JSON-RPC using the
<code>getdeprecationinfo</code> method.</p>
<p>The following table shows End-of-Support information for recent <code>zcashd</code> releases. It is
automatically updated during each release. "End of Support" dates are estimated at that
time, and may shift due to changes in network solution power.</p>

<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Backing up your Zcash private keys is the best way to be proactive about
preventing loss of access to your ZEC.</p>
<p>Problems resulting from bugs in the code, user error, device failure, etc. may
lead to losing access to your wallet (and as a result, the private keys of
addresses which are required to spend from them).</p>
<p>No matter what the cause of a corrupted or lost wallet could be, we highly
recommend all users backup on a regular basis. Anytime a new address in the
wallet is generated, we recommending making a new backup so all private keys
for addresses in your wallet are safe.</p>
<p>Note that a backup is a duplicate of data needed to spend ZEC so where you keep
your backup(s) is another important consideration. You should not store backups
where they would be equally or increasingly susceptible to loss or theft.</p>
<h2 id="instructions-for-backing-up-your-wallet-andor-private-keys"><a class="header" href="#instructions-for-backing-up-your-wallet-andor-private-keys">Instructions for backing up your wallet and/or private keys</a></h2>
<p>These instructions are specific for the officially supported Zcash Linux
client. For backing up with third-party wallets, please consult with user
guides or support channels provided for those services.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to make sure you have at least one other copy of the
private keys needed to spend your ZEC and view your shielded ZEC.</p>
<p>For all methods, you will need to include an export directory setting in your
config file (<code>zcash.conf</code> located in the data directory which is <code>~/.zcash/</code>
unless it's been overridden with <code>datadir=</code> setting):</p>
<p><code>exportdir=path/to/chosen/export/directory</code></p>
<p>You may chose any directory within the home directory as the location for
export &amp; backup files. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.</p>
<p>Note that zcashd will need to be stopped and restarted for edits in the config
file to take effect.</p>
<h3 id="using-backupwallet"><a class="header" href="#using-backupwallet">Using <code>backupwallet</code></a></h3>
<p>To create a backup of your wallet, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli backupwallet &lt;nameofbackup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The backup will be an exact copy of the current state of your wallet.dat file
stored in the export directory you specified in the config file. The file path
will also be returned.</p>
<p>If you generate a new Zcash address, it will not be reflected in the backup
file.</p>
<p>If your original <code>wallet.dat</code> file becomes inaccessible for whatever reason,
you can use your backup by copying it into your data directory and renaming the
copy to <code>wallet.dat</code>.</p>
<h3 id="using-z_exportwallet--z_importwallet"><a class="header" href="#using-z_exportwallet--z_importwallet">Using <code>z_exportwallet</code> &amp; <code>z_importwallet</code></a></h3>
<p>If you prefer to have an export of your private keys in human readable format,
you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli z_exportwallet &lt;nameofbackup&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a file in the export directory listing all transparent and
shielded private keys with their associated public addresses. The file path
will be returned in the command line.</p>
<p>To import keys into a wallet which were previously exported to a file, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli z_importwallet &lt;path/to/exportdir/nameofbackup&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-z_exportkey-z_importkey-dumpprivkey--importprivkey"><a class="header" href="#using-z_exportkey-z_importkey-dumpprivkey--importprivkey">Using <code>z_exportkey</code>, <code>z_importkey</code>, <code>dumpprivkey</code> &amp; <code>importprivkey</code></a></h3>
<p>If you prefer to export a single private key for a shielded address, you can
use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli z_exportkey &lt;z-address&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the private key and will not create a new file.</p>
<p>For exporting a single private key for a transparent address, you can use the
command inherited from Bitcoin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli dumpprivkey &lt;t-address&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the private key and will not create a new file.</p>
<p>To import a private key for a shielded address, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli z_importkey &lt;z-priv-key&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will add the key to your wallet and rescan the wallet for associated
transactions if it is not already part of the wallet.</p>
<p>The rescanning process can take a few minutes for a new private key. To skip
it, instead use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcash-cli z_importkey &lt;z-private-key&gt; no

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Use <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> RPC call to shield coinbase UTXOs.</p>
<p><strong>Who should read this document</strong></p>
<p>Miners, Mining pools, Online wallets</p>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>The current Zcash protocol includes a consensus rule that coinbase rewards must
be sent to a shielded address.</p>
<h2 id="user-experience-challenges"><a class="header" href="#user-experience-challenges">User Experience Challenges</a></h2>
<p>A user can use the z_sendmany RPC call to shield coinbase funds, but the call
was not designed for sweeping up many UTXOs, and offered a suboptimal user
experience.</p>
<p>If customers send mining pool payouts to their online wallet, the service
provider must sort through UTXOs to correctly determine the non-coinbase UTXO
funds that can be withdrawn or transferred by customers to another transparent
address.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>
<p>The z_shieldcoinbase call makes it easy to sweep up coinbase rewards from
multiple coinbase UTXOs across multiple coinbase reward addresses.</p>
<pre><code>z_shieldcoinbase fromaddress toaddress (fee) (limit)
</code></pre>
<p>The default fee is 0.0010000 ZEC and the default limit on the maximum number of
UTXOs to shield is 50.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>Sweep up coinbase UTXOs from a transparent address you use for mining:</p>
<pre><code>zcash-cli z_shieldcoinbase tMyMiningAddress zMyPrivateAddress
</code></pre>
<p>Sweep up coinbase UTXOs from multiple transparent addresses to a shielded
address:</p>
<pre><code>zcash-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" zMyPrivateAddress
</code></pre>
<p>Sweep up with a fee of 1.23 ZEC:</p>
<pre><code>zcash-cli z_shieldcoinbase tMyMiningAddress zMyPrivateAddress 1.23
</code></pre>
<p>Sweep up with a fee of 0.1 ZEC and set limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to
shield at 25:</p>
<pre><code>zcash-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" zMyPrivateAddress 0.1 25
</code></pre>
<h3 id="asynchronous-call"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-call">Asynchronous Call</a></h3>
<p>The <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> RPC call is an asynchronous call, so you can queue up
multiple operations.</p>
<p>When you invoke</p>
<pre><code>zcash-cli z_shieldcoinbase tMyMiningAddress zMyPrivateAddress
</code></pre>
<p>JSON will be returned immediately, with the following data fields populated:</p>
<ul>
<li>operationid: a temporary id to use with <code>z_getoperationstatus</code> and
<code>z_getoperationresult</code> to get the status and result of the operation.</li>
<li>shieldedUTXOs: number of coinbase UTXOs being shielded</li>
<li>shieldedValue: value of coinbase UTXOs being shielded.</li>
<li>remainingUTXOs: number of coinbase UTXOs still available for shielding.</li>
<li>remainingValue: value of coinbase UTXOs still available for shielding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="locking-utxos"><a class="header" href="#locking-utxos">Locking UTXOs</a></h3>
<p>The <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> call will lock any selected UTXOs. This prevents the
selected UTXOs which are already queued up from being selected for any other
send operation.  If the <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> call fails, any locked UTXOs are
unlocked.</p>
<p>You can use the RPC call <code>lockunspent</code> to see which UTXOs have been locked.
You can also use this call to unlock any UTXOs in the event of an unexpected
system failure which leaves UTXOs in a locked state.</p>
<h3 id="limits-performance-and-transaction-confirmation"><a class="header" href="#limits-performance-and-transaction-confirmation">Limits, Performance and Transaction Confirmation</a></h3>
<p>The number of coinbase UTXOs selected for shielding can be adjusted by setting
the limit parameter. The default value is 50.</p>
<p>If the limit parameter is set to zero, the zcashd <code>mempooltxinputlimit</code> option
will be used instead, where the default value for <code>mempooltxinputlimit</code> is
zero, which means no limit.</p>
<p>Any limit is constrained by a hard limit due to the consensus rule defining a
maximum transaction size of 100,000 bytes.</p>
<p>In general, the more UTXOs that are selected, the longer it takes for the
transaction to be verified.  Due to the quadratic hashing problem, some miners
use the <code>mempooltxinputlimit</code> option to reject transactions with a large number
of UTXO inputs.</p>
<p>Currently, as of November 2017, there is no commonly agreed upon limit, but as
a rule of thumb (a form of emergent consensus) if a transaction has less than
100 UTXO inputs, the transaction will be mined promptly by the majority of
mining pools, but if it has many more UTXO inputs, such as 500, it might take
several days to be mined by a miner who has higher or no limits.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-z_shieldcoinbase-transaction"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-z_shieldcoinbase-transaction">Anatomy of a z_shieldcoinbase transaction</a></h3>
<p>The transaction created is a shielded transaction.  It consists of a single
joinsplit, which consumes coinbase UTXOs as input, and deposits value at a
shielded address, minus any fee.</p>
<p>The number of coinbase UTXOs is determined by a user configured limit.</p>
<p>If no limit is set (in the case when limit parameter and <code>mempooltxinputlimit</code>
options are set to zero) the behaviour of z_shieldcoinbase is to consume as
many UTXOs as possible, with <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> constructing a transaction up
to the size limit of 100,000 bytes.</p>
<p>As a result, the maximum number of inputs that can be selected is:</p>
<ul>
<li>P2PKH coinbase UTXOs ~ 662</li>
<li>2-of-3 multisig P2SH coinbase UTXOs ~ 244.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of using <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> on testnet to shield multi-sig coinbase UTXOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Block 141042 is almost ~2 MB in size (the maximum size for a block) and
contains 1 coinbase reward transaction and 20 transactions, each indivually
created by a call to z_shieldcoinbase.
<ul>
<li>https://explorer.testnet.z.cash/block/0050552a78e97c89f666713c8448d49ad1d7263274422272696187dedf6c0d03</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drilling down into a transaction, you can see there is one joinsplit, with
244 inputs (vin) and 0 outputs (vout).

<h2 id="prometheus-support"><a class="header" href="#prometheus-support">Prometheus support</a></h2>
<p><code>zcashd</code> can optionally expose an HTTP server that acts as a Prometheus scrape
endpoint. The server will respond to <code>GET</code> requests on any request path.</p>
<p>To enable the endpoint, add <code>-prometheusport=&lt;port&gt;</code> to your <code>zcashd</code>
configuration (either in <code>zcash.conf</code> or on the command line). After
restarting <code>zcashd</code> you can then test the endpoint by querying it:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://127.0.0.1:&lt;port&gt;
# TYPE zcash_net_out_messages counter
zcash_net_out_messages 181

# TYPE zcash_net_in_bytes_total counter

# TYPE zcash_chain_verified_block_total counter
zcash_chain_verified_block_total 162
...
</code></pre>
<p>By default, access is restricted to localhost. This can be expanded with
<code>-metricsallowip=&lt;ip&gt;</code>, which can specify IPs or subnets. Note that HTTPS is
not supported, and therefore connections to the endpoint are not encrypted or
authenticated. Access to the endpoint should be assumed to compromise the
privacy of node operations, by the provided metrics and/or by timing side
channels. Non-localhost access is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> if the node has a
wallet holding live funds.</p>
<h3 id="metrics-collection-with-docker"><a class="header" href="#metrics-collection-with-docker">Metrics collection with Docker</a></h3>
<p>A docker-compose.yml has been provided in <code>./contrib/metrics</code> that sets up
local instances of <code>prometheus</code> and <code>grafana</code> and provides a dashboard that
charts several of the various metrics exposed by <code>zcashd</code>'s <code>prometheus</code>
endpoint. Note that both <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code> must ordinarily be run
with superuser permissions (use <code>sudo</code>) when running on Linux.</p>
<p><code>docker-compose up</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> will start local instances of <code>prometheus</code> and <code>grafana</code>,
accessible over HTTP on ports <code>9090</code> and <code>3030</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>(substitute the root directory where you have checked out the <code>zcash</code> git

<p><code>~/.zcash/zcash.conf</code> must be updated to enable <code>prometheus</code> and to allow the
<code>prometheus</code> server launched via <code>docker-compose</code> to connect to the <code>zcashd</code>
prometheus endpoint. The following commands can be used to detect the local IP
address for the <code>prometheus</code> server and add it to the <code>~/.zcash/zcash.conf</code>
file.</p>
<p>First, figure out where <code>prometheus</code> is running.</p>
<pre><code>export PROMETHEUS_DOCKER_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' zcashd-prometheus)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, update your <code>~/.zcash/zcash.conf</code> file to open port <code>9969</code> and allow
connections from the <code>zcashd-prometheus</code> docker container.</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; PROM_CONF &gt;&gt; ~/.zcash/zcash.conf
prometheusport=9969
metricsallowip=$PROMETHEUS_DOCKER_IP/32

</code></pre>
<p>You may then (re)start <code>zcashd</code> and navigate to
<a href="http://localhost:9090/targets?search=">http://localhost:9090/targets?search=</a>
to verify that the <code>prometheus</code> server is able to connect to the <code>zcashd</code>
prometheus endpoint; you should see the host
<code>http://host.docker.internal:9969/</code> having <code>UP</code> status. Once this is working,
navigate to
<a href="http://localhost:3030/d/U4U58t-Gk/zcashd-metrics">http://localhost:3030/d/U4U58t-Gk/zcashd-metrics</a>
to view the dashboard. The username and password for this local grafana
instance are set by default to <code>admin</code>/<code>admin</code>; the UI will ask you to change
this on first use. Data gathered by the running prometheus instance and changes
that you make to the grafana interface will be persisted across restarts.</p>

<p>Tor can be used to provide a layer of network anonymity for Zcash users.
Additionally, Zcash users may chose to connect only to Tor hidden services, and
also to expose their own Tor hidden service to allow users to connect to them
over the Tor network.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Install Tor</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The easiest way to install Tor is to use the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser Bundle</a>.  For headless
installs, you probably want to install the Tor daemon.  The Tor Project
provides <a href="https://support.torproject.org/apt/">instructions</a> for doing this on
common Linux distributions.  Note that the Tor Browser Bundle exposes a SOCKS
listener on tcp/9150 by default, while the Tor daemon exposes the SOCKS
listener on tcp/9050.  For the purposes of the example below, we'll assume that
you're using the Tor daemon and that the SOCKS listener is on tcp/9050.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run zcashd over Tor</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Configuring zcashd to use a Tor SOCKS proxy will route all outgoing connections
over Tor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcashd -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
</code></pre>
<p>Yay!  Your zcashd node is now leveraging the Tor network to connect to other
zcashd nodes.  But there's more fun to be had.  By creating a
<a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TorOnionServices">Tor Hidden Service</a>.
you can help promote privacy for Zcash users by advertising your node's .onion
address to other Tor Zcash users.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Expose your zcashd via a Tor hidden service (optional)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Edit your /etc/tor/torrc (or equivalent config file) to map the hidden service
to your zcashd TCP listener.  The directory can be whatever you like but the
port numbers should be equal to the zcashd p2p listen port (8233 by default).
An example is below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address

#HiddenServiceVersion 3
#HiddenServicePort 8233 127.0.0.1:8233

# use the generated v2 Onion hostname until v3 support is complete
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/zcash_hidden_service_v2/
HiddenServiceVersion 2
HiddenServicePort 8233 127.0.0.1:8233
</code></pre>
<p>Note that zcashd does not yet support Onion v3 addresses, but will do so before
v2 addresses are removed from Tor.  See <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3051">this
issue</a> for more information on
what's required to make zcashd support v3 Onion addresses.</p>
<p>After making these edits to /etc/tor/torrc, restart tor to create the hidden
service hostname and keys.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl restart tor
</code></pre>
<p>Then set a bash variable to provide your Onion service hostname to zcashd so it
can advertise your node to other Tor capable nodes on the Zcash network.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ export MY_ONION_HOSTNAME=`sudo cat /var/lib/tor/zcash_hidden_service_v2/hostname`
</code></pre>
<p>Now configure the zcashd node to use the Tor proxy, enable the TCP listener
(only on localhost), and advertise your onion address so that other nodes on
the Zcash network can connect to you over Tor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ zcashd -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=$MY_ONION_HOSTNAME -listen -bind=127.0.0.1 -listenonion=0
</code></pre>
<p>zcashd flags used:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-proxy=ip:port</code>: sets the proxy server. This must match the port IP and port
on which your Tor listener is configured.</li>
<li><code>-externalip=&lt;ip|host&gt;</code>: sets the publicly routable address that zcashd will
advertise to other zcash nodes. This can be an IPv4, IPv6 or .onion address.
Onion addresses are given preference for advertising and connections. Onionv3
addresses are <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3051">not yet supported</a>.</li>
<li><code>-listen</code>: Enable listening for incoming connections with this flag;
listening is off by default, but is needed in order for Tor to connect to
zcashd.</li>
<li><code>-bind=ip</code>: Bind (only) to this IP.  Will bind to all interfaces by default
if <code>listen=1</code>.</li>
<li><code>-listenonion=&lt;0|1&gt;</code>: Enable or disable autoconfiguration of Tor hidden
service via control socket API.  Disabled in this example because we manually
configured the hidden service in /etc/tor/torrc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your node is up and running, you can use <code>zcash-cli</code> to verify that it
is properly connected to other Zcash nodes over the p2p network, and is
correctly advertising its Onion address to the network.</p>

<li>Dynamically Configure Onion Service (Optional)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket
API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. zcashd
has been updated to make use of this.</p>
<p>This configuration could be used instead of manually configuring the Onion
service as in step 2 above.</p>
<p>If Tor is running (and proper authentication has been configured), zcashd
automatically creates a hidden service to listen on. zcashd will also use Tor
automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be
successfully opened.</p>
<p>This new feature is enabled by default if zcashd is listening (<code>-listen</code>) and
requires a Tor connection to work. It can be explicitly disabled with
<code>-listenonion=0</code> and, if not disabled, configured using the <code>-torcontrol</code>
and <code>-torpassword</code> settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass
<code>-debug=tor</code>.</p>
<p>Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication
methods to be configured:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cookie authentication, which requires write access to the <code>CookieAuthFile</code>
specified in Tor configuration. In some cases, this is preconfigured and the
creation of a hidden service is automatic. If permission problems are seen
with <code>-debug=tor</code> they can be resolved by adding both the user running tor
and  the user running zcashd to the same group and setting permissions
appropriately. On Debian-based systems the user running zcashd can be added
to the debian-tor group, which has the appropriate permissions.</li>
<li>Authentication with the <code>-torpassword</code> flag and a <code>hash-password</code>, which
can be enabled and specified in Tor configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>On Debian systems, where Tor is installed via APT, you can trivially permit
zcashd to connect to the Tor socket by adding the zcash user to the
<code>debian-tor</code> group.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo usermod -aG debian-tor zcash

<h2 id="security-audit"><a class="header" href="#security-audit">Security Audit</a></h2>
<p>Zcash has been subjected to a formal third-party security review. For security
announcements, audit results and other general security information, see
https://z.cash/support/security.html</p>
<h2 id="wallet-encryption"><a class="header" href="#wallet-encryption">Wallet Encryption</a></h2>
<p>Wallet encryption is disabled, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encrypted wallets are unable to correctly detect shielded spends (due to the
nature of unlinkability of JoinSplits) and can incorrectly show larger
available shielded balances until the next time the wallet is unlocked. This
problem was not limited to failing to recognize the spend; it was possible
for the shown balance to increase by the amount of change from a spend,
without deducting the spent amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While encrypted wallets prevent spending of funds, they do not maintain the
shielding properties of JoinSplits (due to the need to detect spends). That
is, someone with access to an encrypted wallet.dat has full visibility of
your entire transaction graph (other than newly-detected spends, which suffer
from the earlier issue).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were concerned about the resistance of the algorithm used to derive wallet
encryption keys (inherited from
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet">Bitcoin</a>) to dictionary attacks
by a powerful attacker. If and when we re-enable wallet encryption, it is
likely to be with a modern passphrase-based key derivation algorithm designed
for greater resistance to dictionary attack, such as Argon2i.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should use full-disk encryption (or encryption of your home directory) to
protect your wallet at rest, and should assume (even unprivileged) users who
are running on your OS can read your wallet.dat file.</p>
<h2 id="side-channel-attacks"><a class="header" href="#side-channel-attacks">Side-Channel Attacks</a></h2>
<p>This implementation of Zcash is not resistant to side-channel attacks. You
should assume (even unprivileged) users who are running on the hardware, or who
are physically near the hardware, that your <code>zcashd</code> process is running on
will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the values of your secret spending keys, as well as which notes you
are spending, by observing cache side-channels as you perform a JoinSplit
operation. This is due to probable side-channel leakage in the libsnark
proving machinery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which notes you own by observing cache side-channel information
leakage from the incremental witnesses as they are updated with new notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which notes you own by observing the trial decryption process of
each note ciphertext on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should ensure no other users have the ability to execute code (even
unprivileged) on the hardware your <code>zcashd</code> process runs on until these
vulnerabilities are fully analyzed and fixed.</p>
<h2 id="rest-interface"><a class="header" href="#rest-interface">REST Interface</a></h2>
<p>The REST interface is a feature inherited from upstream Bitcoin.  By default,
it is disabled. We do not recommend you enable it until it has undergone a
security review.</p>
<h2 id="rpc-interface"><a class="header" href="#rpc-interface">RPC Interface</a></h2>
<p>Users should choose a strong RPC password. If no RPC username and password are
set, zcashd will not start and will print an error message with a suggestion
for a strong random password. If the client knows the RPC password, they have
at least full access to the node. In addition, certain RPC commands can be
misused to overwrite files and/or take over the account that is running zcashd.
(In the future we may restrict these commands, but full node access – including
the ability to spend from and export keys held by the wallet – would still be
possible unless wallet methods are disabled.)</p>
<p>Users should also refrain from changing the default setting that only allows
RPC connections from localhost. Allowing connections from remote hosts would
enable a MITM to execute arbitrary RPC commands, which could lead to compromise
of the account running zcashd and loss of funds. For multi-user services that
use one or more zcashd instances on the backend, the parameters passed in by
users should be controlled to prevent confused-deputy attacks which could spend
from any keys held by that zcashd.</p>
<h2 id="block-chain-reorganization-major-differences"><a class="header" href="#block-chain-reorganization-major-differences">Block Chain Reorganization: Major Differences</a></h2>
<p>Users should be aware of new behavior in Zcash that differs significantly from
Bitcoin: in the case of a block chain reorganization, Bitcoin's coinbase
maturity rule helps to ensure that any reorganization shorter than the maturity
interval will not invalidate any of the rolled-back transactions. Zcash keeps
Bitcoin's 100-block maturity interval for generation transactions, but because
JoinSplits must be anchored within a block, this provides more limited
protection against transactions becoming invalidated. In the case of a block
chain reorganization for Zcash, all JoinSplits which were anchored within the
reorganization interval and any transactions that depend on them will become
invalid, rolling back transactions and reverting funds to the original owner.
The transaction rebroadcast mechanism inherited from Bitcoin will not
successfully rebroadcast transactions depending on invalidated JoinSplits if
the anchor needs to change. The creator of an invalidated JoinSplit, as well as
the creators of all transactions dependent on it, must rebroadcast the
transactions themselves.</p>
<p>Receivers of funds from a JoinSplit can mitigate the risk of relying on funds
received from transactions that may be rolled back by using a higher minconf
(minimum number of confirmations).</p>
<h2 id="logging-z_-rpc-calls"><a class="header" href="#logging-z_-rpc-calls">Logging z_* RPC calls</a></h2>
<p>The option <code>-debug=zrpc</code> covers logging of the z_* calls.  This will reveal
information about private notes which you might prefer not to disclose.  For
example, when calling <code>z_sendmany</code> to create a shielded transaction, input
notes are consumed and new output notes are created.</p>
<p>The option <code>-debug=zrpcunsafe</code> covers logging of sensitive information in z_*
calls which you would only need for debugging and audit purposes.  For example,
if you want to examine the memo field of a note being spent.</p>
<p>Private spending keys for z addresses are never logged.</p>
<h2 id="potentially-missing-required-modifications"><a class="header" href="#potentially-missing-required-modifications">Potentially-Missing Required Modifications</a></h2>
<p>In addition to potential mistakes in code we added to Bitcoin Core, and
potential mistakes in our modifications to Bitcoin Core, it is also possible
that there were potential changes we were supposed to make to Bitcoin Core but
didn't, either because we didn't even consider making those changes, or we ran
out of time. We have brainstormed and documented a variety of such
possibilities in <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/826">issue #826</a>, and
believe that we have changed or done everything that was necessary for the
1.0.0 launch. Users may want to review this list themselves.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="deprecated-features"><a class="header" href="#deprecated-features">Deprecated Features</a></h1>
<p>In order to support the continuous improvement of <code>zcashd</code>, features are
periodically deprecated and removed when they have been superseded or are no
longer useful.  Deprecation follows a 3-stage process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially, a feature will be marked as DEPRECATED in the release notes and
user-facing documentation, but no other changes are made; the feature
continues to be available and function as normal. While features at this
stage remain enabled by default, they may be explicitly disabled by
specifying <code>-allowdeprecated=none</code> on the command line when starting the
node, or by including <code>allowdeprecated=none</code> as a line in the <code>zcash.conf</code>
file.</li>
<li>In the next stage of deprecation, the feature will be disabled by default.
Disabled features may be reenabled via use of the <code>-allowdeprecated</code> flag.</li>
<li>In the third stage, the feature is fully removed and is no longer available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Features that enter Stage 1 in a particular release will be disabled by default
after no fewer than 3 releases that update <code>zcashd</code>'s minor-version, and
features will only be fully removed after a total of at least 6 minor-version updates.
<code>zcashd</code>'s release schedule intends to produce a release that updates the minor
version every 6 weeks, so deprecated features remain accessible by default for
approximately 18 weeks, and then can be expected to be removed no less than 36
weeks after their initial deprecation. Deprecation and removal timelines might
be extended beyond this on a case-by-case basis to satisfy user requirements.</p>
<h1 id="currently-deprecated"><a class="header" href="#currently-deprecated">Currently Deprecated</a></h1>
<h2 id="stage-1"><a class="header" href="#stage-1">Stage 1</a></h2>
<p>The following features are deprecated, but remain enabled by default. These features
will be disabled if <code>-allowdeprecated=none</code> is added to the CLI arguments when starting

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="expectations-for-dns-seed-operators"><a class="header" href="#expectations-for-dns-seed-operators">Expectations for DNS Seed operators</a></h1>
<p>Zcash attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds,
but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network.
As such, DNS seeds must be run by entities which have some minimum
level of trust within the Zcash community.</p>
<p>Other implementations of Zcash software may also use the same
seeds and may be more exposed. In light of this exposure, this
document establishes some basic expectations for operating DNS seeds.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected to follow good
host security practices, maintain control of applicable infrastructure,
and not sell or transfer control of the DNS seed. Any hosting services
contracted by the operator are equally expected to uphold these expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DNS seed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and
functioning Zcash nodes from the public network to the best of the
operator's understanding and capability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not
single out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an
urgent technical necessity and disclosed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any logging of DNS queries should be only that which is necessary
for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Zcash
network and must not be retained longer than necessary nor disclosed
to any third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information gathered as a result of the operators node-spidering
(not from DNS queries) may be freely published or retained, but only
if this data was not made more complete by biasing node connectivity
(a violation of expectation (1)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators are encouraged, but not required, to publicly document the
details of their operating practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries
related to the DNS seed operation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If these expectations cannot be satisfied the operator should discontinue
providing services and contact the active Zcash development team as well as
creating an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash">Zcash repository</a>.</p>
<p>Behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in some
situations but should be discussed in public in advance.</p>

<p><code>zcashd</code> is primarily a C++ codebase, but most new code is being written in Rust

<h2 id="auditing-rust-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#auditing-rust-dependencies">Auditing Rust dependencies</a></h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet"><code>cargo-vet</code></a> to audit our Rust dependencies. This means that after
adding a new dependency, or updating existing dependencies with <code>cargo update</code>,
CI will fail until corresponding audits have been added.</p>
<p>We also have a significant number of pre-existing unaudited dependency versions
that are excluded from auditing checks. We aim to reduce this list over time.
New entries should not be added to the exclusion list without justification.</p>
<p>To audit a dependency, first <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/install.html">install <code>cargo-vet</code></a> and then follow the
<a href="https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/performing-audits.html">"Performing Audits" guide</a>. If you are updating a dependency then instead of
auditing the new version in its entirety, you can optionally just audit the
delta between the old and new versions - even if the old version is in the
"unaudited" exclusion list.</p>
<h2 id="adding-new-dependencies-in-online-rust-mode"><a class="header" href="#adding-new-dependencies-in-online-rust-mode">Adding new dependencies in online-Rust mode</a></h2>
<p>The <code>zcashd</code> build system pins all dependencies, and in order to facilitate
reproducible builds, <code>cargo</code> is configured to run in offline mode with vendored
crates. This means that if, for example, you add the <code>foobar</code> crate to
<code>Cargo.toml</code>, you will likely see an error similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo check
error: no matching package named `foobar` found
location searched: registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
required by package `librustzcash v0.2.0 (/path/to/zcash)`
</code></pre>
<p>To add dependencies that are compatible with the reproducible build system, you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, if you've made changes to dependencies in <code>Cargo.toml</code>, these must be reverted before the next step:
<pre><code>git stash
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Next, reconfigure the build system for "online" mode:
<pre><code>CONFIGURE_FLAGS=--enable-online-rust ./zcutil/build.sh
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Now, introduce the dependency changes into <code>Cargo.toml</code>. If you saved changes in Step 1 with <code>git stash</code>, you can reapply them:
<pre><code>git stash pop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Update <code>Cargo.lock</code>:
<pre><code>cargo check
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Commit the changes to <code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>Cargo.lock</code> together:
<pre><code>git commit ./Cargo.{toml,lock}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Verify the reproducible build works in vendored/offline mode without the <code>--enable-online-rust</code> flag:
<pre><code>./zcutil/build.sh
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-an-unpublished-rust-dependency"><a class="header" href="#using-an-unpublished-rust-dependency">Using an unpublished Rust dependency</a></h2>
<p>Occasionally we may need to depend on an unpublished git revision of a crate.
We sometimes want to prove out API changes to the <code>zcash_*</code> Rust crates by
migrating <code>zcashd</code> to them first, before making a public crate release. Or we
might need to cut a <code>zcashd</code> release before some upstream dependency has
published a fix we need. In these cases, we use patch dependencies.</p>
<p>For example, to use an unpublished version of the <code>orchard</code> crate that includes
a new API, add the following patch to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
# This dependency is listed with a version, meaning it comes from crates.io; the
# patch goes into a [patch.crates-io] section.
orchard = "0.4"
...

[patch.crates-io]
orchard = { git = "https://github.com/zcash/orchard.git", rev = "..." }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the git repository contains a workspace of interconnected crates
(for example, https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash), you will need to provide
patches for each of the dependencies that reference the same git revision.</p>
<p>You also need to update <code>.cargo/config.offline</code> to add a replacement definition
for each <code>(git, rev)</code> pair. Run <code>./test/lint/lint-cargo-patches.sh</code> to get the
lines that need to be present.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>./qa/supply-chain/config.toml</code> needs to be updated to ignore patched
dependencies. Run <code>cargo vet regenerate audit-as-crates-io</code>, and then ensure the
newly-added lines are of the form <code>audit-as-crates-io = false</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-local-rust-dependency"><a class="header" href="#using-a-local-rust-dependency">Using a local Rust dependency</a></h2>
<p>During development, you can use a locally checked out version of a dependency
by applying a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section"><code>cargo</code> patch</a>.</p>
<p>For example, to use a local version of the <code>orchard</code> crate that includes a new
API, add the following patch to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
# This dependency is listed with a version, meaning it comes from crates.io; the
# patch goes into a [patch.crates-io] section.
orchard = "0.0"
...

[patch.crates-io]
# Comment out any existing patch, if present.
# orchard = { git = "https://github.com/zcash/orchard.git", rev = "..." }

# Add this patch (both relative and absolute paths work):
orchard = { path = "../relative/path/to/orchard" }
</code></pre>
<p>Usually you can apply a patch to use a locally checked out dependency without
needing to build <code>zcashd</code> in online-Rust mode. However, if your local changes
include a new dependency, you will need to ensure you are in online-Rust mode.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="regtest"><a class="header" href="#regtest">Regtest</a></h1>
<p><em>Regtest</em> ("regression test") is one of the three <em>network types</em>
supported by Zcash, the others being <code>testnet</code> and <code>mainnet</code>.
Regtest is an entirely local, self-contained mode -- your node or nodes
do not talk with peers out in the world. It gives you complete
control of the state of the blockchain and the sequence of events.
You start with an empty blockchain (just the genesis block, block 0).
Blocks can be mined instantly, and must be created explicitly.</p>
<p>You can run one or more regtest nodes on the same system.
The <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/qa/rpc-tests">RPC tests</a>
use <code>regtest</code> mode (usually starting multiple nodes), but you may use it
manually and interactively to learn, test, and experiment. Most often
just one node is used in this case.</p>
<h2 id="example-session"><a class="header" href="#example-session">Example session</a></h2>
<p>Here's a sample session (after you've built <code>zcashd</code> and <code>zcash-cli</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir /tmp/regtest-datadir
$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/tmp/regtest-datadir/zcash.conf
regtest=1
rpcuser=u
rpcpassword=p
rpcport=18132
EOF
$ src/zcashd -daemon -datadir=/tmp/regtest-datadir
</code></pre>
<p>Watch <code>tmp/regtest-datadir/regtest/debug.log</code> to see what <code>zcashd</code> is doing.
It may also be useful to start <code>zcashd</code> with <code>-debug</code> to generate much
more logging. Now we can send RPCs to the node:</p>
<pre><code>$ src/zcash-cli -datadir=/tmp/regtest-datadir getblockchaininfo
{
  "chain": "regtest",
  "blocks": 0,
  "initial_block_download_complete": false,

<h2 id="network-upgrades"><a class="header" href="#network-upgrades">Network upgrades</a></h2>
<p>Zcash has adopted a series of
<a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/consensus/upgrades.cpp">network upgrades</a>.
On <code>mainnet</code> and <code>testnet</code>, these activate at
fixed, known block heights (<a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L117">example</a>).
In <code>regtest</code> mode, you determine the activation heights. Upgrades may occur at
any height greater than 0, and multiple upgrades can occur at the same height. The upgrades
have a strict ordering (as shown in the upgrades source file); for example, Canopy can't
be activated before Blossom.</p>
<p>You specify the upgrade heights using multiple <code>-nuparams=</code><em>&lt;branch-id&gt;</em> arguments.
(The branch IDs are available in the
<a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/consensus/upgrades.cpp">upgrades.cpp file</a>)
It's convenient to add these to the configuration file, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt;/tmp/regtest-datadir/zcash.conf
nuparams=76b809bb:1
nuparams=f5b9230b:5
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>(Alternatively, you can specify these on the <code>zcashd</code> command line.)
You need not activate every upgrade explicitly. The example activates Sapling
(branchID 76b809bb) at height 1; activating Sapling implies activating Overwinter, so this
is done automatically. Similarly, activating Heartwood at height 5
also simultaneously activates Blossom. Since no later upgrades are specified, none
of them will activate, regardless of height reached.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: if you change the network upgrade heights from one
test run to the next, it's almost always necessary to start fresh
by removing the data directory, otherwise you'll encounter strange errors.</p>
<p>You can see which network upgrades are currently active and which are pending
(using the above <code>nuparams</code> settings as an example):</p>
<pre><code>$ src/zcash-cli -datadir=/tmp/regtest-datadir generate 2

<h2 id="manual-testing-within-an-rpc-python-test-run"><a class="header" href="#manual-testing-within-an-rpc-python-test-run">Manual testing within an RPC (Python) test run</a></h2>
<p>It is often useful, either when debugging an issue or simply when you want to put
the node into a certain state, to use the RPC test framework to produce the desired
state and then be able to manually interrogate and modify that state using <code>zcash-cli</code>
to execute RPC calls. An easy way to do that is as follows:</p>
<p>Add the line <code>import time; time.sleep(999999)</code> (the units are seconds) somewhere
within an RPC test to pause its execution at that point. Start the test, and then:</p>
<pre><code>$ ps alx | grep zcashd
0  1000   96247   96246  20   0 1426304 123952 futex_ SLl+ pts/12   0:18 /g/zcash/src/zcashd -datadir=/tmp/test9d907s8a/96246/node0 -keypool=1 -discover=0 -rest -nuparams=5ba81b19:1 -nuparams=76b809bb:1 -debug=mempool -mempooltxcostlimit=8000
0  1000   96274   96246  20   0 744092 85568 -      RLl+ pts/12     0:05 /g/zcash/src/zcashd -datadir=/tmp/test9d907s8a/96246/node1 -keypool=1 -discover=0 -rest -nuparams=5ba81b19:1 -nuparams=76b809bb:1 -debug=mempool -mempooltxcostlimit=8000
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can interact with the running test node by copy-and-pasting its
<code>-datadir</code> argument, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ src/zcash-cli -datadir=/tmp/test9d907s8a/96246/node0 getblockchaininfo
</code></pre>
<p>(The other <code>zcashd</code> command-line arguments are generally not needed by
<code>zcash-cli</code>.) You can see the running node's debug log file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/test9d907s8a/96246/node0/regtest/debug.log
</code></pre>
<p>or look at its configuration file.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/test9d907s8a/96246/node0/zcash.conf
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, the RPC test framework can teach us more about running <code>regtest</code> nodes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="platform-tier-policy"><a class="header" href="#platform-tier-policy">Platform Tier Policy</a></h1>
<h2 id="general"><a class="header" href="#general">General</a></h2>
<p>ECC provides three tiers of platform support, modeled after the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/platform-tier-policy.html">Rust Target Tier Policy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Zcash developers provide no guarantees about tier 3 platforms; they exist in the
codebase, but may or may not build.</li>
<li>ECC's continuous integration checks that tier 2 platforms will always build, but they
may or may not pass tests.</li>
<li>ECC's continuous integration checks that tier 1 platforms will always build and pass
tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a new tier 3 platform imposes minimal requirements; we focus primarily on avoiding
disruption to other ongoing Zcash development.</p>
<p>Tier 2 and tier 1 platforms place work on Zcash developers as a whole, to avoid breaking
the platform. The broader Zcash community may also feel more inclined to support
higher-tier platforms in their downstream uses of <code>zcashd</code> (though they are not obligated
to do so). Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts from the maintainers
of the platform, to demonstrate value and to minimize any disruptions to ongoing Zcash
development.</p>
<p>This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed platform at a given level of
support.</p>
<p>Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless overridden by a
stronger requirement.</p>
<p>While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves human
judgment. Platforms must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as determined by
the judgment of the approving reviewers. Reviewers and team members evaluating platforms
and platform-specific patches should always use their own best judgment regarding the
quality of work, and the suitability of a platform for the Zcash project. Neither this
policy nor any decisions made regarding platforms shall create any binding agreement or
estoppel by any party.</p>
<p>For a list of all supported platforms and their corresponding tiers ("tier 3", "tier 2",
or "tier 1"), see <a href="dev/../user/platform-support.html">Platform Support</a>.</p>
<p>The availability or tier of a platform in Zcash releases is not a hard stability guarantee
about the future availability or tier of that platform. Higher-level platform tiers are an
increasing commitment to the support of a platform, and we will take that commitment and
potential disruptions into account when evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a
platform that has been part of a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a platform
will not generally affect existing stable releases, only current development and future
releases.</p>
<p>In this policy, the words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" specify absolute requirements that a
platform must meet to qualify for a tier. The words "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" specify
requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the approving teams may grant
an exception for good reason. The word "MAY" indicates something entirely optional, and
does not indicate guidance or recommendations. This language is based on
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">IETF RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tier-3-platform-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-3-platform-policy">Tier 3 platform policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, ECC provides no official support for a platform, so we place minimal
requirements on the introduction of platforms.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 3 platform MUST be reviewed and approved by a member of the ECC core
team based on these requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform MUST provide documentation for the Zcash community explaining how to build
for the platform, using cross-compilation if possible. If the platform supports running
binaries, or running tests (even if they do not pass), the documentation MUST explain
how to run such binaries or tests for the platform, using emulation if possible or
dedicated hardware if necessary.</li>
<li>Tier 3 platforms MUST NOT impose burden on the authors of pull requests, or other
developers in the community, to maintain the platform. In particular, do not post
comments (automated or manual) on a PR that derail or suggest a block on the PR based on
a tier 3 platform. Do not send automated messages or notifications (via any medium,
including via @) to a PR author or others involved with a PR regarding a tier 3
platform, unless they have opted into such messages.</li>
<li>Patches adding or updating tier 3 platforms MUST NOT break any existing tier 2 or tier 1
platform, and MUST NOT knowingly break another tier 3 platform without approval of the
ECC core team.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a tier 3 platform stops meeting these requirements, or the platform shows no signs of
activity and has not built for some time, or removing the platform would improve the
quality of the Zcash codebase, we MAY post a PR to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="tier-2-platform-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-2-platform-policy">Tier 2 platform policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, the Zcash developers guarantee that a platform builds, and will reject
patches that fail to build for a platform. Thus, we place requirements that ensure the
platform will not block forward progress of the Zcash project.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 2 platform MUST be reviewed and approved by the ECC core team based
on these requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, the ECC infrastructure team MUST approve the integration of the platform into
Continuous Integration (CI), and the tier 2 CI-related requirements. This review and
approval MAY take place in a PR adding the platform to CI, or simply by an infrastructure
team member reporting the outcome of a team discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>A tier 2 platform MUST have value to people other than its proponents. (It MAY still be
a niche platform, but it MUST NOT be exclusively useful for an inherently closed group.)</li>
<li>A tier 2 platform MUST have a designated team of developers (the "platform maintainers")
supporting it, without the need for a paid support contract.</li>
<li>The platform MUST NOT place undue burden on Zcash developers not specifically concerned
with that platform. Zcash developers are expected to not gratuitously break a tier 2
platform, but are not expected to become experts in every tier 2 platform, and are not
expected to provide platform-specific implementations for every tier 2 platform.</li>
<li>The platform MUST build reliably in CI, for all components that ECC's CI considers
mandatory.</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 3 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tier 2 platform MAY be demoted or removed if it no longer meets these requirements.</p>
<h2 id="tier-1-platform-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-1-platform-policy">Tier 1 platform policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, the Zcash developers guarantee that a platform builds and passes all tests,
and will reject patches that fail to build or pass the test suite on a platform. We hold
tier 1 platforms to our highest standard of requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 platforms MUST have substantial, widespread interest within the Zcash community,
and MUST serve the ongoing needs of multiple production users of Zcash across multiple
organizations or projects. These requirements are subjective. A tier 1 platform MAY be
demoted or removed if it becomes obsolete or no longer meets this requirement.</li>
<li>The platform MUST build and pass tests reliably in CI, for all components that ECC's CI
considers mandatory.</li>
<li>Building the platform and running the test suite for the platform MUST NOT take
substantially longer than other platforms, and SHOULD NOT substantially raise the
maintenance burden of the CI infrastructure.</li>
<li>Tier 1 platforms MUST NOT have a hard requirement for signed, verified, or otherwise
"approved" binaries. Developers MUST be able to build, run, and test binaries for the
platform on systems they control, or provide such binaries for others to run. (Doing so
MAY require enabling some appropriate "developer mode" on such systems, but MUST NOT
require the payment of any additional fee or other consideration, or agreement to any
onerous legal agreements.)</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 2 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tier 1 platform MAY be demoted or removed if it no longer meets these requirements but
still meets the requirements for a lower tier.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="deprecation-procedure"><a class="header" href="#deprecation-procedure">Deprecation Procedure</a></h1>
<p>From time to time, features of <code>zcashd</code> and its associated wallet and RPC API are
deprecated to allow eventual removal of functionality that has been superseded
by more recent improvements. Deprecation follows a process whereby deprecate
features can be explicitly turned on or off using the
<code>-allowdeprecated=&lt;feature&gt;</code> CLI argument.</p>
<p><code>zcashd</code> internally supports two sets of deprecated feature flags in
<code>src/deprecation.h</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DEFAULT_ALLOW_DEPRECATED</code> contains the set of features that remain available
for use without having to be specifically enabled using <code>-allowdeprecated</code>.</li>
<li><code>DEFAULT_DENY_DEPRECATED</code> contains the set of features that are not enabled
by default, and must be explicitly enabled using <code>-allowdeprecated</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deprecation of a feature occurs as a 3-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A deprecation flag is selected for the feature, and added to
<code>DEFAULT_ALLOW_DEPRECATED</code>. The fact of its deprecation is announced, and
any functionality that supersedes the deprecated feature (if any) is
documented, in the release notes. The string <code>DEPRECATED</code> is added to
user-facing API documentation and CLI help text.</li>
<li>The deprecation flag is removed from <code>DEFAULT_ALLOW_DEPRECATED</code> and added to
<code>DEFAULT_DENY_DEPRECATED</code>.</li>
<li>The deprecated feature is removed entirely, and its deprecation flag is
removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Features that enter Stage 1 in a particular release should be disabled by
default after no fewer than 3 releases that update <code>zcashd</code>'s
minor-version, and features should only be fully removed after a total of 6 minor-version
updates. <code>zcashd</code>'s release schedule intends to produce a release that updates
the minor version every 6 weeks, so deprecated features remain accessible by
default for approximately 18 weeks, and then can be expected to be removed no
less than 36 weeks from their initial deprecation. The deprecation timeline for
each newly deprecated feature should be documented in
<a href="dev/../user/deprecation.html">../user/deprecation.md</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="design"><a class="header" href="#design">Design</a></h1>
<p>Zcash was originally a fork of Bitcoin 0.11.2, and as such the <code>zcashd</code> node architecture
is very similar to <code>bitcoind</code>. There are however several differences, most notably the
addition of shielded pools to the consensus logic and full node state.</p>
<p>In this section of the book, we describe the overall architecture that we inherit from
<code>bitcoind</code>, the changes we have made to the inherited components, and the new components
we have introduced.</p>

<h2 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the main context in which <code>CTxOut::IsNull()</code> is used. The other is a
single spot in the mempool code. Once we've backported the
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195">per-txout CoinsDB</a> we can
hopefully eliminate this method.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="p2p-data-propagation"><a class="header" href="#p2p-data-propagation">P2P data propagation</a></h1>
<p>This page contains notes about how block and transaction data is tracked and propagated by
<code>zcashd</code>. Most of this behaviour is inherited from Bitcoin Core, but some differences have
developed.</p>
<p>Some of this content is duplicated from in-code comments, but assembling this summary in
one place is generally useful for understanding the overall dynamic :)</p>
<h2 id="recentrejects"><a class="header" href="#recentrejects"><code>recentRejects</code></a></h2>
<p>When a transaction is rejected by <code>AcceptToMemoryPool</code>, the transaction is added to the
<code>recentRejects</code> Bloom filter, so that we don't process it again. The Bloom filter resets
whenever the chain tip changes, as previously invalid transactions might become valid.</p>
<p>To prevent DoS attacks against wallets submitting transactions, <code>recentRejects</code> needs to
store a commitment to the entire transaction. This ensures that if a transaction is
malleated by a network peer to invalidate its authorizing data, the node will ignore
future advertisements of that specific transaction, but still request alternative versions
of the same txid (which might have valid authorizing data).</p>
<ul>
<li>For pre-v5 transactions, the txid commits to the entire transaction, and the wtxid is
the txid with a globally-fixed (all-ones) suffix.</li>
<li>For v5+ transactions, the wtxid commits to the entire transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maporphantransactions"><a class="header" href="#maporphantransactions"><code>mapOrphanTransactions</code></a></h2>
<p>Upstream uses this map to store transactions that are rejected by <code>AcceptToMemoryPool</code>
because the node doesn't have their transparent inputs. <code>zcashd</code> inherits this behaviour
but limits it to purely-transparent transactions (that is, if a transaction contains any
shielded components, the node rejects it as invalid and adds it to <code>recentRejects</code>).</p>
<p><code>mapOrphanTransactions</code> indexes transactions by txid. This means that if an orphan
transaction is received (spending transparent UTXOs the node does not know about), and it
also happens to be invalid for other reasons (subsequent <code>AcceptToMemoryPool</code> rules that
haven't yet been checked), then the node will not request any v5+ transactions with the
same txid but different authorizing data. This does not create a DoS problem for wallets,
because an adversary that manipulated an orphan transaction to be invalid under the above
constraints would also need to prevent the orphan's parent from entering the mempool, and
eventually a parent is reached that is not an orphan. Once the orphan's direct parent is
accepted, the orphan is re-evaluated, and if it had been manipulated to be invalid, its
wtxid is added to <code>recentRejects</code> while its txid is removed from <code>mapOrphanTransactions</code>,
enabling the wallet to rebroadcast the unmodified transaction.</p>
