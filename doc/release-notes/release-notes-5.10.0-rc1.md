Notable changes
===============

RPC Changes
-----------

- A bug in parameter handling has been fixed for the `getaddresstxids` and
  `getaddressdeltas` RPC methods. Previously, leaving the end height unset
  would cause the start height to be set to zero and therefore ignored.
  The end height is now also automatically bounded to the chain tip; passing
  an end height greater than the chain tip height no longer results in an
  error; values up to and including the chain tip are returned instead.

Platform Support
----------------

- Debian 10 (Buster) has been removed from the list of supported platforms.
  It reached EoL on June 30th 2024, and does not satisfy our Tier 2 policy
  requirements.

Other
-----

- The `zcash-inspect` tool (which was never distributed, and was present in this
  repository for debugging purposes) has been moved to the `devtools` subfolder
  of the https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash repository.

Fixes
-----

- Security fixes for vulnerabilities disclosed in
  https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/07/03/disclose-orphan-dos/
  and https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/07/03/disclose-inv-buffer-blowup/ have
  been backported to `zcashd`.

Changelog
=========

0xPierre (1):
      Update README.md: fix discord link

Daira-Emma Hopwood (16):
      depends: Show the URLs from which dependencies are being downloaded.
      Update Python code to work, and avoid deprecation warnings, on Python 3.12.
      Make use of the 'filter' option to `tarfile.extractall` conditional on the version of Python that added it (3.11.4).
      Work around one of the race conditions in the `wallet_deprecation` test.
      Implement "ZIP 236: Blocks must balance exactly" for NU6.
      Add `test_framework.mininode.uint256_from_reversed_hex`.
      Ensure that `create_coinbase` can work on regtest after various network upgrades: * after Blossom, there is an extra halving of the block reward; * after NU5, `nExpiryHeight` must be equal to the block height; * after NU6, we need to take into account the lockbox value.
      Extend `coinbase_funding_streams` to also test ZIP 236.
      test_validation gtest: also test more recent upgrades in `ContextualCheckInputsDetectsOldBranchId`.
      test_validation gtest: make it more concise and readable.
      test_validation gtest: also test initialization of the other chain value pool balances (Sapling, Orchard, and Lockbox). This is not a very thorough test but it will do for now.
      test_validation gtest: calls to internal functions (`SetChainPoolValues` and `ReceivedBlockTransactions`) are required to take a lock on `cs_main` in order to work when compiled with `--enable-debug`.
      test_validation gtest: ensure that there can be no UB as a result of fake `CBlockIndex` objects still being referenced at the end of the test.
      Try to reduce the incidence of some RPC test race conditions.
      Update RPC test Python dependencies: base58 is required; simplejson is not.
      Mark mempool_nu_activation as a flaky RPC test.

Greg Griffith (1):

Gregory Maxwell (4):
      This eliminates the primary leak that causes the orphan map to  always grow to its maximum size.

      Treat orphans as implicit inv for parents, discard when parents rejected.
      Increase maximum orphan size to 100,000 bytes.
